This is a MVP version of the app. Since this is a work in progress we anticipate a lot of tweaks and changes to optimize and improve the app. This includes finding a better designed API that is best suited for the purpose of the app. Please find below a list of anticipated future improvements to the application:

* FUTURE UPDATES:
* Enable voice searches.
* Another page should be the welcome page with a search box and a word of the day.
* Find a way to screen definitions and searches or get a new API.
* Design results to be delivered on a card with a definition and an illustration etc.
* Find a way to restrict and control dictionary content with age appropriate categories.
* Fine tune the dictionary to only deliver one or two definitions at the most.
* A user can create an account so they can take advantage of additional features.
