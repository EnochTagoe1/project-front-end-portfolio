The purpose of this project will be to build a pictographic dictionary for elementary school kids to improve their vocabulary => ("WhatsTheWord"?)

The project API link is https://api.dictionaryapi.dev/api/v2/entries/en/

User Stories:

- A User can type a word and get a definiton (and an image).
- A user can add a new word to to favorites glossary list.
- A user can see the definition of a word.
- A user can also see the phonetic pronounciation of the word.
- A user can see synonymns of the word

* FUTURE PLANS:
* Enable voice searches
* Another page should be the welcome page with a search box and a word of the day.
* How can I limit the vocabulary to be age appropriate?
* Combine definition and images? Do I need 2 API's?
* Find a way to restrict and control dictionary content with age appropriate categories.
* Fine tune the dictionary to only deliver one or two definitions
* A user can create an account so they can take advantage of additional features.
