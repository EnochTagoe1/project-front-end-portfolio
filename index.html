        If a child asks a lot of questions but is not quite ready for Google without supervision...then they need "WhatsTheWord?". An online illustrated dictionary with words that are age appropriate.


        <!-- My daughter likes to ask a lot of questions. I try my best to give her the right answers. Every now and then she will ask for the meaning of a word that is not "kosher" or age appropriate. And for that reason I will not have her google every word on her own at this time. That is where "WhatsTheWord?" come in. To allow kids to have an illustrated dictionary with words that are age appropriate without parental supervision. So go ahead and type your word...we have an age appropriate definition for your child!  -->
