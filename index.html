        My daughter likes to ask a lot of questions. I try my best to give her the right answers. Every now and then she will ask for the meaning of a word that is not kosher or age appropriate. And for that reason I will not have her google every word on her own. That is where "WhatsTheWord?" comes in. To allow kids to have an illustrated dictionary with words that are age appropriate without parental supervision. So go ahead and type your word...we have a age appropriate definition waiting for your child!
